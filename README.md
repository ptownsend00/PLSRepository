# PLSRepository
This is site devoted to storing PLSR chemometric equations for predicting plant foliar traits from spectral data.
Eventually, we will create a searchable database of PLS equations associated with EcoSIS.org, the online spectral library.
Examples of spectral data include:
--From portable spectrometers such as ASD, Ocean Optics, Spectral Evolution, Spectravista, etc.
--From imaging spectrometers such as AVIRIS, AVIRIS-NG, Hyperion, NEON AOP, etc.
Examples of traits that are mapped as a function of spectra include:
--Pigment concentrations
--nitrogen concentration
--leaf mass per area (LMA)
Critical metadata would include:
--What the physical measurement is (reflectance, absorptance, etc.)
--The domain of applicability (e.g.,: northern temperate forests, corn, etc.)
--model diagnostics (R^2, RMSE, etc.)
--literature citation
